# Results

## Study population and follow up

There initially were 76665 observations on 19303 study participants considered for inclusion.
After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study period between 2010-01-01 and 2018-12-31 and considering the status at the last available follow up time for each individual a total of 7972 participants were included in the analysis.
The epidemiological profile of the participant included in the study was a
male participant (5,833 (73%))
with an average (SD) age of 31 (20) years.
The average (SD) time of follow up was 5.24 (2.87) years.

Races were not homogeneously available in the study population with
5,251 (66%) individuals being white;
3,456 (43%) were single (never married) at the time of injury,
and most participants were well educated with 3,573 (45%) at greater than high school level.
A total of 4,709 (59%) were employed and
3,751 (48%) participants lived in an urban area.

The observed overall mortality was 15% in the study period.
The distribution of cases appear homogeneous across SES quintiles (Figure 1), ranging from 19% to 22%.
We will test the effect of SES quintiles on the hazard rate in the next section.
See also Figure A2 in the appendix for the distribution of sexes in each SES quintile in the study population.

## Effect of SES on mortality

The previous seizure disorder diagnosis was missing for most of the study population and was not included in the model as a covariate to preserve study power.
After excluding participants with missing data from other variables a total of 4829 complete cases were available for analysis (Table 2).

When considering only the crude effect of SES on mortality neighborhood to which the individuals were discharged was associated with mortality.
Participants who were discharged to a comfortable neighborhood had increased chance of dying
(HR = 1.28,
95% CI = 1.04 to 1.57),
when compared to those discharged to a prosperous neighborhood.
Participants discharged to a distressed neighborhood also had a higher mortality risk
(HR = 1.26,
95% CI = 1.02 to 1.55),
when compared to those discharged to a prosperous neighborhood.

After controlling for all relevant covariates, this effect can no longer be consistently detected, at the 5% level of significance.
The point estimates for all adjusted estimates of SES effect range from 0.99 to 1.12, relative to the prosperous neighborhood, and that represents a narrower range of point estimates than the crude estimates (from 1.08 to 1.28).

When considering only late deaths the SES effect is also not significantly associated with mortality, and estimates relative to a prosperous neighborhood range from 1.00 to 1.07 (which is an even narrower range than the crude estimates).
The adjusted estimates of all-time mortality can be compared with late mortality where in all neighborhoods the CI of the adjusted estimate is contained within the late deaths' CIs, except for mid-tier and distressed neighborhoods that exceed the respective upper ranges of confidence.
The respective point estimates in all cases do not change by a large amount, where most differences fall under 0.1 HR.
It can be concluded that effect of SES on the risk of late death is not substantially different from all-time death in the study population, after controlling for all covariates.


Table: **Table 2** Effect of SES on mortality; HR estimates were adjusted for sex, race, age, substance abuse, education, employment status, urbanization, spinal cord injury, cause of injury, rehabilitation payor, residence after rehab discharge, days from injury to discharge, FIM motor and FIM cognitive at discharge.

The survival curves of both sexes by SES quintiles can be seen in Figure 2.
Since none of the curves cross, the proportional hazards assumption is assumed to be held i nthe study data.
Overall, the distressed neighborhoods appear to have a lower survival probability then other neighborhoods.
This appears to be true for both sexes, and males had a higher risk of dying than females in all neighborhoods.
This plot was cropped at 85% survival for presentation purposes, see Figure A3 in the appendix for an uncropped version.
