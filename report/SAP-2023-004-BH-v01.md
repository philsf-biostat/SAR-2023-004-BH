- SES: socioeconomic status

# Context

## Objectives

To determine the effect of socioeconomic status of the neighborhood on mortality of patients with brain injury.

## Hypotheses

The neighborhood to which an individual is discharged from acute care affects the mortality rates of individuals that suffered a brain injury.

# Data

## Raw data

The raw data was received in three distinct databases, one containing clinical and epidemiological data, a second one with follow up on the status of individuals and a third one containing SES information of each Zip code.
The clinical and followup tables were merged by study ID, and this was joined with the SES table by the Zip code of the neighborhood of discharge, resulting in the original raw data base.

Before joining the tables by zipcode, the missing locations at discharged were assumed to not have changed since injury, and those values were used to fill missing zip data where available.
To maximise the availability of SES data, this was also assumed for each follow up location, where the preferred information used was the zip code at discharge, when available.
The date of death of participants was available, and its presence was used as an indicator of the living status of the participant at each follow up.

The original data base had
711
variables collected on
76665
observations from
19303 individuals.

<!-- Upon study start the raw data will be collected in a raw table, that will be processed before analysis. -->
<!-- The raw dataset to be collected will have -->
<!-- 711 -->
<!-- variables collected on -->
<!-- 76665 -->
<!-- observations. -->

<!-- This dataset will include the dates of entry and exit of the cohort, or the date of hospital admission and the date where the endpoint was reached (either an event, or hospital discharge). -->
<!-- Table 1 shows the structure of the raw dataset. -->

<!-- ```{r analytical data} -->
<!-- analytical_mockup %>% -->
<!--   pander(caption = "**Table 1** Raw dataset structure.") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Each row represents all information collected from each study participant, and each participant included will require a unique study ID. -->
<!-- The outcome should be recorded as a binary variable: either the study participant reached the endpoint -->
<!-- ([outcome]) -->
<!-- or reached the end of study period without experiencing the event. -->
<!-- This information can be recorded in either text form (eg, yes/no), or an indicator -->
<!-- ([outcome] = 1, -->
<!-- end of observation time or discharge = 0). -->
<!-- Exposure and all comorbidities should be recorded as binary variables, whenever possible. -->
<!-- All comorbidities should be recorded as binary variables, whenever possible. -->

<!-- Surgery length should be recorded in -->
<!-- minutes, -->
<!-- hours, -->
<!-- and ICU length in -->
<!-- days. -->
<!-- weeks. -->
<!-- months. -->

<!-- Surgery type will be recorded as a categorical variable. -->
<!-- It is recommended that the number of classes (types of surgery) be as small as possible, to avoid loss of precision in the analysis estimates, without the need to increase the sample size. -->
<!-- Broader categories of surgeries should be preferred, whenever possible. -->

## Analytical dataset

<!-- After the cleaning process -->
<!-- 20 -->
<!-- variables were included in the analysis -->
<!-- with -->
<!-- 7972 -->
<!-- observations. -->
After the cleaning process
20
variables were included in the analysis.
The total number of observations excluded due to incompleteness and exclusion criteria will be reported in the analysis.
<!-- Table 1 shows the structure of the analytical dataset. -->



All variables in the analytical set were labeled according to the raw data provided and values were labeled according to the data dictionary for the preparation of production-quality results tables and figures.

# Study parameters

## Study design

Retrospective cohort.

## Inclusion and exclusion criteria

## Exposures

SES.

## Outcomes

**Specification of outcome measures** (Zarin, 2011):

1. (Domain) Mortality
2. (Specific measurement) Death
3. (Specific metric) Time-to-event
4. (Method of aggregation) Hazard ratio

**Primary outcome**

Death after a brain injury.

## Covariates

- Race
- Age at injury
- Substance Problem Use
- Education
- Employment status
- Rural area
- Previous seizure disorder diagnosis
- Spinal cord injury
- Cause of injury
- Primary rehabilitation payor
- Residence after rehab discharge
- Days From Injury to Rehab Discharge
- FIM Motor at Discharge
- FIM Cognitive at Discharge

# Statistical methods

## Statistical analyses

### Descriptive analyses

The epidemiological profile of the study participants will be described.
Demographic
<!-- (sex, age and BMI) -->
and clinical variables
<!-- ( [vars] ) -->
will be described as
mean (SD)
<!-- median (IQR) -->
or as counts and proportions (%), as appropriate.
The distributions of participants' characteristics will be summarized in tables and visualized in exploratory plots.

### Inferential analyses

<!-- All comparisons between groups will be performed as univariate analyses. -->
<!-- Continuous variables will be compared between groups with the -->
<!-- independent t test with Welch correction. -->
<!-- paired t test. -->
<!-- Mann-Whitney test. -->
<!-- signed rank Wilcoxon test. -->
<!-- Differences in distribution of categorical variables will be assessed with the -->
<!-- Fisher exact test. -->
<!-- chi-square test. -->
<!-- McNemar test. -->

All inferential analyses will be performed in the statistical models (described in the next section).

### Statistical modeling

The hazard of mortality will be assessed with multivariate Cox regression models.
In order to assess if there is an effect of the SES of the neighborhood to which the participant was discharged on mortality will be assessed with three models.
A crude estimate of the HR between each SES quintiles and mortality will be calculated as the basis of interpretation of the effect.
The best estimate of the true effect will be calculated adjusting for all covariates described in section 4.5.
Finally, the same model will be fitted to a filtered dataset that excludes all deaths happening within one year, to assess if there is an effect on late mortality in a sensitivity analysis.

### Missing data

No missing data imputation will be performed.
All evaluations will be performed as complete case analyses.
Missing data counts and proportions will be reported in tables.

## Significance and Confidence Intervals

All analyses will be performed using the significance level of 5%.
All significance hypothesis tests and confidence intervals computed will be
two-tailed.
<!-- left-tailed. -->
<!-- right-tailed. -->

## Study size and Power

N/A

## Statistical packages

This analysis will be performed using statistical software `R` version 4.2.1.

# Observations and limitations

**Recommended reporting guideline**

The adoption of the EQUATOR network (<http://www.equator-network.org/>) reporting guidelines have seen increasing adoption by scientific journals.
All observational studies are recommended to be reported following the STROBE guideline (von Elm et al, 2014).
<!-- All clinical trials are recommended to be reported following the CONSORT guideline (Schulz K F, Altman D G, Moher D., 2010). -->
<!-- All systematic reviews are recommended to be reported following the PRISMA guideline (Page et al, 2021). -->
<!-- All protocols for systematic reviews are recommended to be reported following the PRISMA-P guideline (Page et al, 2021). -->

<!-- In particular when a retrospective study is conducted using hospital records, it is recommended that the RECORD extension of the STROBE guideline is considered (Benchimol et al, 2015). -->
