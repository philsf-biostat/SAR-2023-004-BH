# Results

## Study population and follow up

There initially were `r Nobs_orig` observations on `r Nobs_orig_id` study participants considered for inclusion.
After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study period between `r study_period[1]` and `r study_period[2]` and considering the status at the last available follow up time for each individual a total of `r Nobs_final` participants were included in the analysis.
The epidemiological profile of the participant included in the study was a
male participant (`r inline_text(tab_desc, variable = SexF, level = "Male")`)
with an average (SD) age of `r inline_text(tab_desc, variable = AGE)` years.
The average (SD) time of follow up was `r inline_text(tab_desc, variable = Time)` years.

```{r tab_desc}
tab_desc %>%
  as_kable(
    caption = "**Table 1** caption"
  )
```

The observed overall mortality was 15% in the study period.
The distribution of cases appear homogeneous across SES quintiles (Figure 1), ranging from 19% to 22%.
We will test the effect of SES quintiles on the hazard rate in the next section.

```{r fig1, fig.cap="**Figure 1** caption"}
# ![Age](../figures/outcome.png)
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/outcome.png", error = FALSE)
```

## Effect of SES on mortality

```{r tab_inf}
tab_inf %>%
  as_kable(
    caption = "**Table 2** caption"
  )
```

```{r fig2, fig.cap="**Figure 2** caption"}
# ![Age](../figures/outcome.png)
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/surv.png", error = FALSE)
```
